# About the «Bernstein» theme

«Bernstein» (engl. amber) is a dark theme for desktop applications written in qooxdoo v3.0 or above. The decorators of the theme are mainly based on gradients and shadows, i. e. only very few image files are involved, which makes it a relatively lean theme causing hardly any flicker effects.

If you are looking for a "clean" and "modern" design for your GUI, «Bernstein» is certainly not what you want. However, if you enjoy "dark and dirty" desktop environments this theme may be just what you've been waiting for.

What «Bernstein» (and its accompanying demo application) is clearly lacking is a decent icon theme. The Tango or Oxygen icons that are included in the framework in my opinion don't match a dark design at all. So, any link to a suitable icon set with an appropriate license would be very much appreciated.
